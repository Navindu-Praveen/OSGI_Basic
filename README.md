# OSGI_Basic
Bundles:

In OSGi, a bundle is the fundamental unit of deployment and modularity. It encapsulates Java classes, resources, and metadata. A bundle can be dynamically installed, started, stopped, updated, and uninstalled.
OSGi Framework:

The OSGi framework is the runtime environment that manages the lifecycle of bundles. It provides the necessary infrastructure for loading, starting, stopping, and uninstalling bundles. Popular implementations include Apache Felix and Eclipse Equinox.
Activator:

A bundle may have an activator class, which implements the BundleActivator interface. The activator is notified when the bundle is started or stopped, allowing it to perform initialization and cleanup tasks.
Services:

OSGi uses a service-oriented architecture. Bundles can offer services, which are Java objects that implement a specific interface. Other bundles can consume these services dynamically, promoting loose coupling and flexibility.
Service Registry:

The service registry is a central repository where OSGi bundles register and discover services. It allows bundles to publish services and find services provided by other bundles.
Dependencies:

Bundles can declare dependencies on other bundles. OSGi ensures that the required dependencies are resolved and loaded before a bundle starts. This helps in managing and resolving dependencies in a modular system.
Dynamic Module System:

OSGi provides a dynamic module system, allowing bundles to be installed, started, stopped, and uninstalled at runtime without affecting the entire application. This supports a highly dynamic and modular architecture.
Versioning:

OSGi supports versioning of bundles and their dependencies. This allows different versions of the same bundle to coexist in the OSGi runtime, facilitating version management and updates.
Bundle Lifecycle:

The typical lifecycle of a bundle involves installation, starting, stopping, and uninstallation. Bundles can be dynamically updated by installing a new version without stopping the entire application.
Manifest File:

Each bundle contains a manifest file (META-INF/MANIFEST.MF) that provides metadata about the bundle, such as its symbolic name, version, activator class, and dependencies.
Here's a minimal example of a simple OSGi bundle manifest file:

plaintext
Copy code
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2
Bundle-SymbolicName: com.example.bundle
Bundle-Version: 1.0.0
Bundle-Activator: com.example.Activator
This is a basic overview, and there's much more to explore and learn in OSGi. For a more in-depth understanding, it's recommended to refer to the official OSGi specifications and documentation.
